## Description 

I have been working on a basic HTML and CSS portfolio design,
The HTML structure I have kept reasonably simple and semantic.
In the CSS I have used a series of flex designs to control the flow of the page,
I have also used some Transform scaling to change the size of the image links on hover,
Along with some box-shadows to make sure the user can clearly see that element is selected.
I then finished this project with Media quiries to keep a smooth looking experience on smaller screen sizes.
